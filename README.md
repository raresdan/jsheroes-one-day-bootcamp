# JSHeroes Bootcamp - Frontend starter

This is the basic starter for getting into frontend development. It consists of some config files (package.json, package-lock.json) and a `src` folder with the 3 main files we'll be writing code in:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
 
Both style and script files are already loaded in the main html file. The html file can be open directly in the browser or via a static server by running the following command in a terminal:
```
npm install
npm run start
```

## What we build

The goal of the bootcamp is for everyone to build a GitHub explorer web application. We'll be using the GitHub API (link coming soon) to fetch data and implement the following functionality on top of this starter:
- Build a static page with semantic HTML elements
- Style your html tags (example coming soon)
- Use JavaScript to dynamically insert tags into your HTML (DOM manipulation)
- Fetch GitHub data from an external API
- Implement search by name
